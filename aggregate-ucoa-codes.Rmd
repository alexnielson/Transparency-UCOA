# Program Description

**Purpose**
I am interested in learning more about how to access and pay with the UCOA codes. I decided to conduct some Exploratory Data Analysis in this document as well.

DURATION: the script will take about 20-30 minutes to run.

**Input(s)**

```{r}
dsn_aws        <- "transpAWS"
dsn_salesforce <- "salesforce"
```

**Output(s)**


# Libraries and Data Sources

```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(magrittr)
library(odbc)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

odbc_aws <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), dsn_aws)
odbc_sf  <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), dsn_salesforce)

rm(dsn_aws, dsn_salesforce)

download.file(
  "http://financialreports.utah.gov/chartofaccounts/ChartofAccountFull.xlsx",
  "ucoa.xlsx",
  mode = "wb")

## Salesforce

Query Salesforce.

# different chart of accounts. I also do not query higher education.

##generate agg tables of interest

### aggregate by description and code
```{r}
agg_fund<-brokenout_reported_ucoa %>%
  group_by(fund_description, fund) %>% 
  count(fund)%>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

agg_function<-brokenout_reported_ucoa %>%

  count(account)%>%

note that the next two aggregations are only contigently useful. If the data is properly cleaned, then they are redundant.
